Zomato Global Expansion Initiative

Overview:- Welcome to the Zomato Global Expansion Initiative repository! This project focuses on developing a dashboard to support data-driven decision-making for Zomato's worldwide expansion strategy. Learners have undertaken various tasks to clean and analyze the data, providing insights and recommendations for newer restaurant locations.

Tasks:- The project tasks include answering objective questions, cleaning the dataset, and providing strategic insights. Learners have also addressed subjective questions, suggesting countries and cities for new restaurant openings and analyzing the impact of various factors on customer ratings and feedback.

Objective Questions:- Objective questions were answered, including the total number of tables and attributes in the data, handling inconsistent and missing values, and performing data analysis using functions like COUNTIFS and AVERAGE.

Subjective Questions:- Subjective questions were addressed by suggesting countries and cities for new restaurant openings based on competition levels and customer ratings. Recommendations were supported by pivot tables and data analysis techniques.

Dashboard Development:- The dashboard consists of year-wise and country slicers to enable interactive exploration of the data. Learners have utilized various Excel functions and visualization techniques to create informative dashboards.
